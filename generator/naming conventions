each dialog file will have a name that fully
represents the entire state.
eg. l1_pr25pc7
        means level 1, player row position 25, player cpl position 7
we can add other things to the name if the level requires it


Text representaion for a level
'.' -> empty space
'#' -> empty space
'p' -> player position
'f' -> win condition
